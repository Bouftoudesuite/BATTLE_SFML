# BATTLE_SFML

BattleSFML is a local (at this time) multi-player 2D turn-based RPG with a minimalist fantasy style in french(at this time).

It is being coded with C++ and SFML Library (the official website is: https://www.sfml-dev.org/index-fr.php).

SFML provides a simple interface to the various components of your PC, to ease the development of games and multimedia applications. It is composed of five modules: system, window, graphics, audio and network.

## The Simplest Setup

If you are building and running Battle SFML from source, this is the simplest way to get started on all operating systems. Here you build and play Battle SFML in a local folder instead of installing it to a standard OS folder (e.g. /usr/local or Program Files).

* Clone the Battle-SFML repo into your user directory.
* Install and configure SFML Library (help: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/#getting-started).
* Compile and run Battle SFML.
